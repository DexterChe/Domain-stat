# Domain Size Statistical Analysis

**Author:** Dmitry Chezganov (GitHub: [DexterChe](https://github.com/DexterChe))  
**Date Created:** 25/10/2024

## Project Overview

This project is designed for the statistical analysis of domain sizes using Python. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that performs various tasks such as data reading, manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. The project demonstrates skills in data handling, analysis, and visualization, as well as the ability to use various Python libraries to solve data processing tasks.

## Features

- **Data Reading and Organization:** Reads data from text files and organizes it into pandas DataFrame structures.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculates and saves statistical data such as mean, standard deviation, median, mode, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizes data using histograms, KDE plots, box plots, and bar charts.
- **Exporting Results:** Exports statistical tables to Microsoft Word format for easy sharing and presentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook `domains_statistics.ipynb`. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, which include:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- python-docx

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy python-docx
```

### Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to perform the statistical analysis and visualization of domain sizes. The notebook is well-documented with comments and markdown cells to guide you through each step of the process.
